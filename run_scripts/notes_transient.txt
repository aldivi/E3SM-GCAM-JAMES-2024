Copy the restart info from the final spinup case to this location (necessary for hybrid run): 
/lcrc/group/e3sm/ac.eva.sinha/E3SM_GCAM_lnd_init/<Name_of_final_spinup_case>

For example, if you did a 600 year final spinup run, copy all files with *601* in the name and the rpointer.* files to this location.

Since the SST ice data starts from 1869 we will reuse the data from 1869-1878 for the first twenty years

We will first run 20 years using:
./xmlchange SSTICE_YEAR_ALIGN=1869
./xmlchange SSTICE_YEAR_START=1869
./xmlchange SSTICE_YEAR_END=1879

The above changes are already included in the run script.

After 20 years are complete we will make following changes:
./xmlchange SSTICE_YEAR_ALIGN=1869
./xmlchange SSTICE_YEAR_START=1869
./xmlchange SSTICE_YEAR_END=2016
./xmlchange CONTINUE_RUN=TRUE
./xmlchange STOP_N=75
./xmlchange RESUBMIT=1

Then you area ready to submit, from this directory:
./case.submit


NOTES ON RUNNING FUTURE SIMULATION WITH GCAM ON:
1. First run gcam in spinup to get the gcam restart files.
   1.1 Set gcam_spinup = .true. in user_nl_gcam and then submit the run for 1 year
   1.2 This will create  restart.0, restart.1, restart.2, restart.3, restart.4 in the run folder.
   1.3 In this model gcam runs for previous years first and writes the restart files and the
       baseline co2 and land/harvest file.
2. Now set gcam_spinup=.false. and continue the run.
